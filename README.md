Windchill is a measure of how cold the air feels on the skin as a result of the combined effect of wind and temperature. As wind increases, heat is carried away from the body at a faster rate, making it feel colder than the actual temperature. The windchill temperature is the temperature the body would feel if it were in a calm environment at the actual temperature.
